## Step 6. Create a simple node.js application to interact with the blockchain

The Cisco blockchain platform comes with a feature rich SDK for nodejs application development.

* When writing a distributed application in node.js, we must remove all of the business logic from the application (typically defined in Controllers) and encode it into the smart contract.

* Using the simple Model View Controller framework, a nodejs distributed application simple servers to route url request and serve the end HTML (Views).

* Data schema and logic that would normally appear in the Model and Controller of an application is encoded in the smart contract.
* To this regard, application logic is shared and must be agreed upon by all participants, and application rules become an immutable component of the blockchain.

In our sample “hello world” node.js application, we define a server that receives two query parameters from the url

```
?contract = the contract ID' as can be found in the admin portal

?asset = an assetID such as the serial number of a barrel (e.g. IPA1) that has previously been defined via the create method
```
