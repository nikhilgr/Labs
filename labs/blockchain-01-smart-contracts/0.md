* **Example Applications of Enterprise Blockchain**

Supply chain digitization is a terrific application of enterprise blockchain. Supply chains have natural enterprise consortiums: groups of enterprises collaborating on common business objective
Blockchain provides a single data platform, with shared ownership of data, for which enterprises can transact. The blockchain is used as a tamper proof “Single source of truth” across supply chain participants addressing pain points such as data reconciliation and leading to business outcomes such as improved counterfeit part detection and management across a supply chain
